If you are not familiar with these 2 words phrase, it comes from the &amp;ldquo;test program&amp;rdquo; that everyone usually write in first place when start learning a new programming language.
What will you encounter in this page? Hopefully, articles about some tecnhnical stuff: programming, system administration, CI/CD&amp;hellip; I love to learn and try new technologies, so please, don&amp;rsquo;t expect too much of this blog posts, because I just want to keep some tracking of my experiences with some technologies and tools that are new to me at that moment: most of the posts will not be &amp;ldquo;expert level&amp;rdquo;, but probably a good place to start learning some technology with me.</description></item></channel></rss>
