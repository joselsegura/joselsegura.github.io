If you are not familiar with this 2-word phrase, it comes from the &amp;ldquo;test program&amp;rdquo; that everyone usually writes first when they start learning a new programming language.
What will you find in this page? Hopefully articles about some tecnhnical stuff: programming, system administration, CI/CDâ€¦ I love to learn and try new technologies, so please don&amp;rsquo;t expect too much of this blog posts, because I just want to keep track of my experiences with some technologies and tools that are new to me at the moment: most of the posts will not be expert level, but probably a good place to start learning some technology with me.</description></item></channel></rss>
