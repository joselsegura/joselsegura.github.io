This blog cannot start in any other way than with "Hello World!". If you are not familiar
with this 2-word phrase, it comes from the "test program" that everyone
usually writes first when they start learning a new programming language.

What will you find in this page? Hopefully articles about some tecnhnical
stuff: programming, system administration, CI/CD… I love to learn and try new
technologies, so please don't expect too much of this blog posts, because I
just want to keep track of my experiences with some technologies and
tools that are new to me at the moment: most of the posts will not be _expert
level_, but probably a good place to start learning some technology with me.

But `whoami`? Well, my name is José-Luis Segura. I am a software engineer
with more than 10 years experience. I studied Computer Science in Spain at my
home town (Ciudad Real).

I have worked for a few of companies, always on software engineering
and a bit of system administration. Currently, I am working for Red Hat,
programming a lot in [Python](https://www.python.org) and
[Golang](https://golang.org/), running systems and interacting with
technologies that were totally new to me one year ago. And, of course, having a
lot of fun learning new things.

I really hope that you enjoy this blog as much as I will enjoy writting it. See
you soon!
