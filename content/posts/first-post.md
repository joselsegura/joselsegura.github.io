This blog cannot start different from a "Hello World!". If you are not familiar
with these 2 words phrase, it comes from the "test program" that everyone
usually write in first place when start learning a new programming language.

What will you encounter in this page? Hopefully, articles about some tecnhnical
stuff: programming, system administration, CI/CD... I love to learn and try new
technologies, so please, don't expect too much of this blog posts, because I
just want to keep some tracking of my experiences with some technologies and
tools that are new to me at that moment: most of the posts will not be "expert
level", but probably a good place to start learning some technology with me.

But `whoami`? Well, my name is Jos√© Luis Segura. I am a Software Engineer
with more than 10 years experience. I studied Computer Science in Spain at my
home town (Ciudad Real).

I have worked for a few of companies, always related with software engineering
and a bit of system administration. Currently I am working for Red Hat,
programming a lot with [Python](https://www.python.org) and
[Golang](https://golang.org/), running in systems and interacting with
technologies that are totally new for me one year ago. And, of course, having a
lot of fun learning new things.

I really hope that you enjoy this blog as much as I will enjoy writting it. See
you soon!
